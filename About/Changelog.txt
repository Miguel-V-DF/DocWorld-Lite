# Changelog for DocWorld Lite
# all the previous changes to the 1.4 update will not be included retroactively

1.4.2 After a long hiatus, I am playing Rimworld again, and I decided to make a pass on DocWorld Lite testing the patches. I will be removing any patches that I don't see much sense to mantain or that the mods haven't been updated to 1.4 till now.

Biome Foraging - Updated the mods target to the 1.4 versions as needed.

Cloth Beds - update 2 nulifying mods, Modern Bed (1.4) and [JPT] Soft Warm Beds (Continued), to their 1.4 versions, and removed [T] MoreBedsCloth that did not get a version for 1.4;
- Added Patches for the following mods adding beds: Polyamory Beds (Vanilla Edition), Loft Bed, Single Royal Beds, Connected Bed, Big and Small Furniture and Bunk Beds. Added patch for the baby crib in Biotech.

Enhanced_Miniaturisation - Removed patch for the obsolet mod Genetic Rim. Patch for torch is disabled as I don't have the time right now to solve the issue with the SanguphageMeetingTorch. Removed the MultiAnalyzer patch as it's not needed anymore, base game has it.

Glass_Requisites: Changed patches to account for changes in the mod or new versions in the following mods:
- Ceiling Lights to Ceiling Light; 
- Raise the Roof 1.4; 
- Removed the patch for Static Quality Plus; 
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded; 
- Simple Utilities: Ceiling, removed the patch as it not needed, inheritance from Vanilla is enough; 
- Removed balance changes to Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer Module that equalized cost and glowradius of Glass+Lights and Spacer versions. Removed patch to Spacer_SunLamp for now as I don't have time to track the error.

Linkables - Tested the patches and removed the Medical System Expansion - Revived, as the 1.4 version, Medical System Expansion 2, doesn't have the workbench as far as I can see.

Misc - Removed the buff to Sun Lamp. Changed patches to target the new versions in 1.4: Expanded Roofing 1.4, Raise the Roof 1.4, Fishing Nets Continued, removed Seeds Please patch as the Lite version doesn't need it. Removed the Fishing Nets Continued path as I don't even understand it (messing with GPU) and I don't want patches here that I can fix if needed. Removed the Rimkead nerf to beauty and confort, I presume you want that if you download that mod. Removed the removal (ha) of the Mamuffalo fur.

Multi_Mod_Support - Removed patch to Survivalist addition as the mod was not updated to 1.4;
- Removed patch for MBS Faux Rock Wall, as I couldn't even find the mod;
- Changed integration with Repair Workbench from [LC] Survival Tools to the sucessor mod Survival Tools;
- Removed patch from Regrowth Cold Bog, due to that mod current inexistence and I didn't find the tree in any of the other Regrowth mods, and to Boreal, due to it being already patched on Expanded Woodworking. Removed the patch for Wastelands too, as frankly, the mod already has a catch all patch that should be enough;
- Disable the patches between Floored and Simply More Bridges, Expanded Materials - Metals and Simple Chains: Lumber, all due to some problems that I don't have time right now to diagnose.

Research Projects - Changed support for the 1.4 version of Raise The Roof, removed patch putting tech level at Medieval;
- Removed patch for RoofBomb as RoofBomb (Continued) already has the feature. 
- Removed patch for Smoked Meat as the balance changes were implemented in the base mod.
- Removed all patches involving [O21] Dragons Not Included, as the mod series was superceeded by the Outland series
- Removed the patch for Industrial Rollers

Stuffed Item - checked the patches, all okay.

1.4.1 removed the Helixien buildings from the Enhanced_Miniaturisation patch. Tried to target their own new mod, but it seems something is coded in assembly level to prevent free movement, I will take a closer look at it later.

1.4.0 updated to 1.4 and tests passed for 1.4 and backwards compatibility with 1.3.
