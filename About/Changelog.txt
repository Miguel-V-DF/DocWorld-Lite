# Changelog for DocWorld Lite
# all the previous changes to the 1.4 update will not be included retroactively

1.4.1 removed the Helixien buildings from the Enhanced_Miniaturisation patch. Tried to target their own new mod, but it seems something is coded in assembly level to prevent free movement, I will take a closer look at it later.

1.4.0 updated to 1.4 and tests passed for 1.4 and backwards compatibility with 1.3.
